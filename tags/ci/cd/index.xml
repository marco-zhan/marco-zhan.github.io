I am not going to talk too much on frontend because this is not the main focus of this challenge.
CI/CD I used AWS CodePipeline for CI/CD of this challenge. The CI/CD pipeline is triggered by code change in the nominated code repository, in my case this is on AWS CodeCommit, but you can use GitHub or other Git services.</description></item></channel></rss>
