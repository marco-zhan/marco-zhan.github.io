I have been using a Raspberry Pi 4 stack as my home server for a while, but it is not powerful enough to run some of the services I want to run, also, my initial purpose to setup a home server was to explore Kubernetes, scalability becomes an issue as I would like to run multiple nodes.</description></item><item><title>I Accidentally Deleted Important Data... What Happened and Introspection</title><link>https://blog.marcozh.com/post/2023-03-29_i-accidentally-deleted-very-important-data-and-introspection/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.marcozh.com/post/2023-03-29_i-accidentally-deleted-very-important-data-and-introspection/</guid><description>What Happened A few days ago in my job, I was patching a bug that touches fairly fundamental level of our code in a production site. Normally, the process is we will wait for our changes to be approved by our peers and then one of us will jump on the production site with the bug and patch it, so instead of a brand-new release, customers get their specific bug fixed straight away.</description></item><item><title>The Cloud Resume Challenge, Part 2 - Hosting Static Webpage with AWS S3, CI/CD in AWS and Frontend</title><link>https://blog.marcozh.com/post/2023-03-25_cloud-resume-challenge-part2/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.marcozh.com/post/2023-03-25_cloud-resume-challenge-part2/</guid><description>Frontend The frontend is pretty straight forward, I used React for writing up my resume webpage, but you can choose from any JavaScript framework of your preference. I am not going to talk too much on frontend because this is not the main focus of this challenge.
CI/CD I used AWS CodePipeline for CI/CD of this challenge. The CI/CD pipeline is triggered by code change in the nominated code repository, in my case this is on AWS CodeCommit, but you can use GitHub or other Git services.</description></item><item><title>The Cloud Resume Challenge, Part 1 - Introduction</title><link>https://blog.marcozh.com/post/2023-03-23_cloud-resume-challenge-introduction/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.marcozh.com/post/2023-03-23_cloud-resume-challenge-introduction/</guid><description>Introduction I recently completed The Cloud Resume Challenge and found it very interesting. I bought my first ever domain, and explored some basic AWS services. This project definitely gets me started on AWS and how powerful it is, so I encourage you to try too. In the next few blogs, I am going to write up how I completed this prject and what I have learned.
Why This Challenge I have always been very keen in Cloud related technology ever since I first heard the term from university course.</description></item></channel></rss>
